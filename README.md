## User Experience - UX

### Design Choices

#### Fonts

* The fonts used were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
* The fonts Roboto and Lato were used because they are popular and therefore more recognisable.
* The font sans-serif was put in as a back up.

#### Icons

* Icons used were taken from [Font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
* All icons used were chosen because they are easily recognisable to clients.

#### Colours



* The primary colour choices of grey and white were chosen because they have a clean clear aspect while contrasting well with each other.
* Black, grey and white were chosen to make the writing stand out against the background.
